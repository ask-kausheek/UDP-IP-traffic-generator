# UDP-IP-traffic-generator

We created a UDP/IP traffic generator which is used in an overall OFDM signal processing proceess. We genarate traffic in bytes and transfer then to PDCP layer and similarily recieve the data from PDCP layer , uplink and downlink is established .

Process :
Ip traffic --> PDCP --> RLC -->MAC --> OFDM signal generation and demodulation
